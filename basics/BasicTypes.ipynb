    "    eg.: 1,13,-1,0 ..\n",
    "2. Floating Point Numbers : Numbers that have decimal part\n",
    "    eg.: 1.0,0.2587, 1.1234 ..\n",

    " String is a character sequence which can be represented in below formats\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Generally strings are represented by enclosing between doublequotes(\") or singlequotes(\")\n",
    " 2. For strings that contain doublequote or singlequote characters in it it would be comfortable to represent those by enclosing it with opposite type of quote characters\n",
    "     For example, \n",
    "     We can represent the string below\n",
    "         This string contains a doublequote(\") character\n",
    "     as 'This string contains a doublequote(\") character'\n",
    "     \n",
    "     and below string\n",
    "         While this has a singlequote(') character\n",
    "     as \"While this has a singlequote(') character\"\n",
    " 3. String that spawn accross multiple lines can be represented as shown below with triple quotes\n",
    "         \"\"\" \n",
    "             This is a multiline string\n",
    "             as it spawns accross multiple lines \n",
    "             \"like this one\"\n",
    "         \"\"\"\n",
    " 4. String that contains both doublequote(s) and singlequote(s) can also be represented using triple quotes\n",
    "         \"\"\" This is a string that contains \" and a '\"\"\"\n",

    "2. It can take either True or False"
